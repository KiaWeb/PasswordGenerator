# PasswordGenerator
Wow. A password generator. How useless.
Go to [this](https://github.com/KiaWeb/PasswordGenerator/) page for releases.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
Very simply run PasswordGen.exe for Windows. For Linux, macOS, etc, Download python, download the source repo, and run "python3 main.py" to run the python script.
Also, this is the BSD license, so anything you do with it, give credit saying `Github/KiaWeb`.
